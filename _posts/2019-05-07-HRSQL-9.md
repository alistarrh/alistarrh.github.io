# Weather Observation Station 4

Let *N* be the number of CITY entries in **STATION**, and let *N'* be the number of distinct CITY names in **STATION**; query the value of *N-N'* from **STATION**. In other words, find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.


**Input Format**

The **STATION** table is described as follows:

 <center>STATION</center>

|Field|Type|
|---|---|
|ID|NUMBER|
|CITY|VARCHAR2(21)|
|STATE|VARCHAR2(2)|
|LAT_N|NUMBER|
|LONG_W|NUMBER|

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

**Solution**--MySQL

```mysql
SELECT (COUNT(CITY)-COUNT(DISTINCT CITY)) FROM STATION
```
