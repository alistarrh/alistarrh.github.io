# Weather Observation Station 5

Query the two cities in **STATION** with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

**Input Format**

The **STATION** table is described as follows:

 <center>STATION</center>

|Field|Type|
|---|---|
|ID|NUMBER|
|CITY|VARCHAR2(21)|
|STATE|VARCHAR2(2)|
|LAT_N|NUMBER|
|LONG_W|NUMBER|

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

**Sample Input**

Let's say that CITY only has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY

**Sample Output**

```mysql
ABC 3
PQRS 4
```

**Explanation**

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with the respective lengths **3**, **3**, **4**, and **3**. The longest-named city is obviously PQRS, but there are **3** options for shortest-named city; we choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

**Note**
**You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query.**

**Solution**--MySQL

```mysql
SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY),CITY limit 1;

SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC,CITY limit 1
```
